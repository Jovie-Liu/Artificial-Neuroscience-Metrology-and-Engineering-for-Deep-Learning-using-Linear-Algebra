# Artificial-Neuroscience-Metrology-and-Engineering-for-Deep-Learning-using-Linear-Algebra

- The project titled *Artificial Neuroscience: Metrology and Engineering for Deep Learning Using Linear Algebra* is a UKRI (UK Research and Innovation) funded EPSRC (Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council) Discipline Hopping in ICT Grant featuring collaborations between the School of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science and the School of Mathematical Sciences at Queen Mary University of London, United Kingdom. Associated with the Centre for Digital Music ([C4DM](https://www.c4dm.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/people/)) and the [Centre for Fundamentals of AI and Computational Theory](https://www.seresearch.qmul.ac.uk/cfcs/people/jiliu/), I work as a Postdoctoral Research Associate co-supervised by [Prof. Mark Sandler](https://www.seresearch.qmul.ac.uk/cmai/people/msandler/#grants) and [Prof. Boris Khoruzhenko](https://www.seresearch.qmul.ac.uk/cpsd/people/bkhoruzhenko/#grants).

- To gain a deeper understanding of the **correlation structure in audio processing neural networks**, we apply Empirical Spectral Density (ESD) techniques to weight matrices to investigate the dynamics of training.

- To build more **efficient, compact, and less energy-consuming neural networks**, we employ tensor decomposition on the weight matrices and examine the effects of low-rank approximation on the neural network behaviors.
